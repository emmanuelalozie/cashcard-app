## My Spring Boot Learning Journey

### Introduction
Welcome to my repository where I document my progress through the Spring Boot course designed for beginners. This course is aimed at helping learners build a solid foundation in Spring Boot, enabling them to apply this knowledge in real-world software development.
I've had the opportunity to interface with Spring Boot in my career, which sparked my interest in its robust capabilities. Keen to deepen my understanding and master its extensive features, I decided to pursue this Spring Boot course to refine my skills and broaden my technical expertise in building modern, scalable applications.

### Course Overview

#### What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a powerful extension of the Spring framework, simplifying the programming model and reducing lots of development time. It enables building production-ready applications quickly and provides a vast spectrum of features and functionalities.

#### About the Course
This beginner-level course is expertly crafted by Spring professionals to guide learners in building and deploying a secure, functional, and well-tested RESTful API for a hypothetical "Family Cash Card" application.

#### Project Focus
**Family Cash Card Application:**
- A modern solution for parents to manage, send, receive, and track allowance funds for their children.
- Functionality to create, edit, delete, and view multiple "cash cards".
- Features cloud-based architecture similar to handling gift cards but for family use.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, I aim to:
- Master the use of Spring Boot to develop a complete RESTful API.
- Understand the architectural benefits and trade-offs of REST.
- Learn to build web applications using Spring Web.
- Connect to databases and map data to Java objects with Spring Data.
- Enhance application security using Spring Security with a security-first approach.

### Hands-On Labs
The course includes interactive labs that do not require any specific installations, using integrated editors and terminals provided within the course environment.

### Prerequisites
A good grasp of Java is required, and familiarity with languages like C# could also be beneficial.

### Course Methodology
- **Project-Based Learning:** The course is structured around a real-world project rather than traditional technical lessons.
- **Task-Centered Lessons:** Each lesson focuses on specific tasks within the project development process.
- **Test-First Development:** Emphasizes writing tests before coding the implementation.
- **Steel Thread Approach:** Prioritizes completing an integration "thread" through all core components of the application for incremental delivery and risk mitigation.

### Documentation and Progress
I will be documenting each step of my learning journey, reflecting on the lessons learned and the challenges encountered. This repository will serve as a living record of my progress and a testament to the skills and knowledge I acquire as I delve deeper into the world of Spring Boot.
